# Project Name

**Author**: Jose Flores and Cara Ottmar 
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is a blog full of many articles. There is a sort function that sorts by author and category. It is built mobile first but is also dynamic. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
User must have knowledge of:
1. local storage -- what to store, when to store, when to retrieve (get, set, json.parse and json.stringify)
2. JSON, AJAX, what they do and when they do it, JSCRIPT, and some basic HTML script ordering sequences

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used AJAX, localStorage, JSON, JS, and HTML for this assignment. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.

03-20-2018 09:30am - forked the starter code and built out our branch. Did a thourough read through to pinpoint new code addtions and researched them
03-20-2018 10:30 - successfully called the appropriate method on index.html, and completed article.js so all articles were retrievable with AJAX, loaded and rendered
03-20-2018 12:30 - Completed the if/else of conditionals to load the articles to the site. 

## Credits and Collaborations
Nicholas for helping to explain local storage and how to use our key, values for this specific instance.
